# Hello, Purdue! 👋

## 1. The Move - Coming Home to the Midwest 🏛️

After many productive years at Kansas State, **Ciampitti Lab is relocating to Purdue University’s Department of Agronomy**. Purdue offers stronger field-research infrastructure, easier collaboration with Midwestern partners, and a good fit for our work in crop modeling and digital agriculture. We thank our K-State colleagues for their support and look forward to:

- 🔬 Expanding high-throughput phenotyping and remote-sensing studies
- 🤝 Working with Purdue’s **Digital Agriculture** and **IDAAS** teams
- 🎓 Mentoring students focused on practical agronomy questions

Stay tuned for job postings, field days, and collaborative projects.

## 2. The Website - A Practical Hub for Data-Driven Agriculture 🌐

We rebuilt the site using **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS**:

### What’s different?

1. **Faster loading** ⚡

   - Static pages are served from a CDN, so they open quickly even on slow rural connections.

2. **Consistent design** 🎨

   - Purdue gold-and-black palette, accessible contrast, and layouts that work from phones to desktop monitors.

3. **Markdown content** ✍️

   - Blog posts live as plain `.md` files in `/blog/`, making edits simple and version-controlled.

4. **Open-source workflow** 🔓
   - Code and documentation are public under OSI-approved licenses.

### Run it locally or contribute 🚀

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ciampitti-Lab/ciampitti-lab.github.io
cd ciampitti-lab.github.io
npm install
npm run dev
```

Thanks for reading. We’re excited for the next phase at Purdue and to share our work through the new site. ✨
